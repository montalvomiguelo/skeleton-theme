# Skeleton Theme

A barebones ☠️ starter theme.

## System requirements

You'll want to ensure you have the following already installed on your local machine before getting started with Skeleton theme:

- **Node:** The current LTS (long-term support) release. We like to use a Node Version Manager like [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).

- **pnpm** This repo uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) as a packages manager.

- **Shopify CLI for themes:** To learn how to install Shopify CLI on Windows, macOS, or Linux, refer to [Install Shopify CLI](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/cli/install).

## Getting started

To start with Skeleton Theme, the following commands are available:

```bash
# Launch the Shopify and Vite servers in parallel
$ pnpm dev --store johns-apparel --live-reload full-page
```

```bash
# Bundle your theme's assets and upload your local theme files to Shopify
$ pnpm run deploy --store johns-apparel
```

Checkout [Shopify CLI commands for themes](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/tools/cli/commands) for more information.
